# Rotation source for mod-playerbots combat selectors.

Each combat Select* in `src/rotations/` follows these lists in order.
Unknown or too-low-level spells are skipped (`CanTryCast` / `HasSpell`) and the
next line is tried. DoTs and keep-up buffs refresh when remaining ≤ ~3s.

Spell and aura IDs: look up names in `dbc_export/Spell.csv`. Cast spell ID and
applied aura ID sometimes differ (e.g. Corruption 172 → 146739, Serpent Sting
1978 → 118253); those maps live in `AuraIdForSpell()` in BotRotation.cpp.

Healers are not covered here yet.
